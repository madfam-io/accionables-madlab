# MADLAB Product Vision

## The Core Idea

**MADLAB is an event convergence orchestrator for neurodivergent minds.**

Everything flows toward a moment. Not tasks in isolation — synchronized movement toward a culminating event, aided by AI agents, adapted to how your brain actually works.

---

## The Synchronized Swimming Principle

What makes synchronized swimming beautiful:

| Principle | In MADLAB |
|-----------|-----------|
| One shared moment | The **Culminating Event** anchors everything |
| Individual preparation | Each person sees their part clearly |
| Visible interdependencies | Your task enables mine — shown, not hidden |
| Rehearsal → Performance | Progressive refinement toward the moment |
| Appears effortless | Complexity handled, beauty visible |

> "Like software for people who think in events, not tasks."

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Culminating Event

The anchor point. Everything backward-plans from here.

**Short-burst events** (MVP focus):
- Popup concert (hours away)
- Exam (tomorrow)
- Presentation (this afternoon)
- Product demo (next week)

**Long-arc events** (Phase 2):
- Retreat (months away)
- Conference (quarters away)
- Album release (year-long arc)
- Wedding

### 2. Convergence Timeline

Gantt reimagined. Not "when does this task happen" but "how does everything sync up at the moment."

```
                                    ★ EVENT
                                    │
    ┌─────────────────────────────┐ │
    │ Venue confirmed             │─┤
    └─────────────────────────────┘ │
          ┌───────────────────────┐ │
          │ Equipment delivered   │─┤
          └───────────────────────┘ │
              ┌───────────────────┐ │
              │ Sound check       │─┤
              └───────────────────┘ │
                  ┌───────────────┐ │
                  │ Doors open    │─┘
                  └───────────────┘
```

Visual principles:
- Event is the focal point (right side, prominent)
- Tasks flow *toward* the event
- Dependencies shown as flowing connections
- Compression visible as event approaches

### 3. AI Agents

Agents fill executive function gaps. Different agents for different needs:

| Agent Type | What It Does | ND Benefit |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| **Breakdown Agent** | Takes event brief → generates task tree | Reduces overwhelm of "where do I start" |
| **Reminder Agent** | Context-aware nudges based on dependencies | Fights time blindness |
| **Draft Agent** | Writes first drafts of communications | Removes writing paralysis |
| **Logistics Agent** | Generates checklists, packing lists, timelines | Externalizes working memory |
| **Sync Agent** | Keeps team members aligned | Reduces coordination anxiety |
| **Calm Agent** | Detects overwhelm, suggests breaks, simplifies view | Prevents shutdown/meltdown |

### 4. Neurodivergency Profiles

Not one UI for everyone. Adaptive experience based on how your brain works.

---

## ND Profile System

### Phase 1: Presets

Start with research-backed presets:

#### ADHD Profile
| Aspect | Optimization |
|--------|--------------|
| **Visual** | High contrast progress, dopamine-friendly celebrations |
| **Information** | One thing at a time, progressive disclosure |
| **Time** | Visual countdown, time-remaining prominent |
| **Motivation** | Streak tracking, micro-wins, novelty rotation |
| **Agents** | Aggressive reminders, task breakdown, body-doubling prompts |

#### Autism Profile
| Aspect | Optimization |
|--------|--------------|
| **Visual** | Predictable layouts, low sensory stimulation, muted palette |
| **Information** | Explicit over implicit, complete information upfront |
| **Time** | Routine-friendly scheduling, transition warnings |
| **Motivation** | Special interest integration, pattern completion |
| **Agents** | Detailed breakdowns, script generators, change notifications |

#### Dyslexia Profile
| Aspect | Optimization |
|--------|--------------|
| **Visual** | OpenDyslexic font option, high icon-to-text ratio |
| **Information** | Audio alternatives, visual-first communication |
| **Time** | Color-coded timelines, spatial over textual |
| **Motivation** | Voice notes, image-based progress |
| **Agents** | Text-to-speech, voice input, simplified language |

#### Combined/Custom Profile
| Aspect | Optimization |
|--------|--------------|
| **Visual** | Mix and match from all profiles |
| **Information** | User-defined preferences |
| **Time** | Customizable displays |
| **Motivation** | Choose your own rewards |
| **Agents** | Select which agents activate |

### Phase 2: Calibration Flow

**"Start Calibration"** — onboarding that determines optimal settings:

```
Welcome to MADLAB.

Let's find out how your brain works best.
This takes about 5 minutes.

[Start Calibration]  [Use a Preset]  [Skip for Now]
```

Calibration modules:

1. **Visual Comfort**
   - Show different UI densities, ask which feels calmer
   - Test color sensitivity
   - Motion/animation preferences

2. **Information Processing**
   - How much detail upfront vs. progressive disclosure
   - Text vs. visual vs. audio preference
   - Explicit instructions vs. implied

3. **Time Relationship**
   - How do you experience time? (slider: "flies by" ↔ "drags")
   - Deadline relationship (motivating vs. anxiety-inducing)
   - Reminder frequency preference

4. **Motivation Patterns**
   - What makes you feel accomplished? (completion, streaks, external validation)
   - Novelty need (high ↔ low)
   - Social accountability preference

5. **Support Needs**
   - Which AI agents sound helpful?
   - How much automation vs. control?
   - Collaboration style (sync vs. async)

**Output**: Personalized profile with explanation of why each setting was chosen.

### Phase 3: Continuous Calibration

The system learns:
- "You seem to engage more in the morning — adjust reminders?"
- "Tasks with visuals get completed faster — add more?"
- "You've ignored 3 reminders — try a different approach?"

---

## Multiplayer Experience

### Core Philosophy
Multiplayer is key. Solo is allowed but not the default.

### Collaboration Model

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  SHARED EVENT   │
                    │  (The Moment)   │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
         ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
         │                   │                   │
    ┌────┴────┐        ┌────┴────┐        ┌────┴────┐
    │ Person A │        │ Person B │        │ Person C │
    │ (ADHD)   │        │ (Autism) │        │ (Custom) │
    └────┬────┘        └────┬────┘        └────┬────┘
         │                   │                   │
    Their view          Their view          Their view
    Their agents        Their agents        Their agents
    Their pace          Their pace          Their pace
```

### Key Features

1. **Shared Event, Personal Views**
   - Everyone sees the same event and deadlines
   - Each person's view is adapted to their ND profile
   - My calm interface doesn't affect your high-contrast interface

2. **Dependency Awareness**
   - "Alex is waiting on your task" (shown gently, not guilt-inducing)
   - "Sam finished their part — here's what unlocked for you"
   - Visual flow of who-enables-whom

3. **Async-First, Sync-Capable**
   - Default: Everyone works at their own pace
   - Optional: Real-time co-working sessions (body-doubling)
   - Sync points: Clear moments where everyone must align

4. **Role Clarity**
   - Clear ownership ("This is yours")
   - Clear handoffs ("This goes to Sam when done")
   - No ambiguity about who does what

5. **Communication Layer**
   - In-context comments on tasks
   - AI-drafted updates ("Here's a summary of progress to share")
   - ND-friendly notifications (batched, not buzzing)

   - Describe the event (AI generates initial task tree)
   - Invite collaborators

2. **Convergence Gantt**
   - Visual timeline flowing toward event
   - Tasks with dependencies
   - Person assignments with avatars
   - Progress indicators

3. **ND Profile (Preset Only)**
   - Choose: ADHD / Autism / Dyslexia / Default
   - Immediate UI adaptation
   - Agent behavior adaptation

4. **Basic AI Agents**
   - Breakdown Agent (event → tasks)
   - Reminder Agent (smart nudges)
   - Draft Agent (communication templates)

5. **Multiplayer Basics**
   - Invite by email/link
   - Shared event view
   - Personal task lists
   - Basic activity feed

### What's NOT in MVP

- Long-arc events (> 1 month)
